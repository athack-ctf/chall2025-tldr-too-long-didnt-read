Beyond its uncivilized and often hostile discussions, TL;DR. (a forum notorious for its unsocial members) once hosted
a valuable flag. Previously, anyone visiting TL;DR. could consult the flag. However, things have since changed.
TL;DR. has abruptly ceased accepting new users and now restricts access to the flag to only those who are already registered.

Now, what remains is a series of odd and isolated discussions among introverts. 
But is there still any value to be found in them?
