Beyond its uncivilized and often hostile discussions, TL;DR. (a forum notorious for its unsocial members) once hosted a valuable flag,
freely available to anyone visiting the site. However, things have since changed. TL;DR. has abruptly ceased accepting new users 
and now limits access to the flag to only those who are already registered.

Now, what remains public is a series of odd and isolated discussions among introverts. But is there still any value to be found in them?
