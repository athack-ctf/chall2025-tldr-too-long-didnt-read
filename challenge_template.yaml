    Beyond its uncivilized and often hostile discussions, TL;DR. (a forum notorious for its unsocial members) once hosted a valuable flag, freely available to anyone visiting the site. However, things have since changed...

    TL;DR. has abruptly ceased accepting new users and now limits access to the flag to only those who are already registered. What remains public now is a series of odd and isolated discussions among introverts. But is there still any value to be found in them?
