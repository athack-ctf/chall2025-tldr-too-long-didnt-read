# @HACK 2025: TL;DR. Too Long; Didn't Read.

> Authored by [Anis](https://github.com/AnixPasBesoin).

- **Category**: `Web`
- **Value**: `450 points`
- **Tags**: `sponsored` `http`

> Beyond its uncivilized and often hostile discussions, TL;DR. (a forum notorious for its unsocial members) once hosted a valuable flag, freely available to anyone visiting the site. However, things have since changed...
> 
> TL;DR. has abruptly ceased accepting new users and now limits access to the flag to only those who are already registered. What remains public now is a series of odd and isolated discussions among introverts. But is there still any value to be found in them?
